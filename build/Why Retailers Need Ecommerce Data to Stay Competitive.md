## The Power of Ecommerce Data Collection and Product Matching

The foundation of competitive retail strategies begins with data collection. Once the data is gathered, the next crucial step is **product matching**.

### What is Product Matching?

Product matching is the process of identifying identical, similar, or equivalent products across competitor catalogs. Retailers use product matching for:

- **Price benchmarking**
- **Assortment gap identification**
- **Promotion monitoring**
- **Competitive landscape analysis**

Manual product comparison methods often fall short, especially when they rely solely on UPCs (Universal Product Codes). Retailers who depend on UPCs alone risk missing variations in pack sizes, product differences, or items from competitors that don't display UPCs. Errors in UPCs can lead to broken links and data blind spots.

### Benefits of Automated Product Matching

Retailers are now adopting machine learning-driven product matching solutions to ensure high-quality, accurate data. These solutions provide a competitive edge by enabling:

- **Price optimization**
- **Assortment adjustments**
- **Confident, data-driven decision-making**

Accurate product matching allows retailers to:

- Identify assortment gaps  
- Align promotional strategies  
- Optimize pricing  
- Understand the competitive landscape  
- Monitor out-of-stock items

## Omnichannel Shoppers: A Retail Goldmine

Accurate ecommerce data and product matching are vital because todayâ€™s shoppers are omnichannel. These hybrid shoppers interact with both online and offline channels, and they **spend more per shopping occasion** than single-channel customers.

### Key Statistics on Omnichannel Shopping

- **60%â€“70%** of consumers consider online browsing or social media shopping the new way to search for and buy products. (*McKinsey*)
- **22%** of online buyers shop at least once a week.
- **54%** of shoppers research products in-store but purchase online.
- **47%** of shoppers pick up online orders in-store and make additional purchases during the visit.

By 2026, **24% of retail purchases** will occur online, with the ecommerce market expected to reach over **$8.1 trillion**. Yet, despite the growing importance of omnichannel experiences, **78% of retailers** admit their customers donâ€™t have a unified shopping experience due to poor data quality.

## Competitive Pricing: A Core Retail Strategy

One of the major advantages of product matching and competitive intelligence is visibility into pricing across the market. Price remains a critical factor for consumers, with **77%** of shoppers considering it a key part of their purchase decisions. This figure has risen **23%** since 2022 as customers search for cost-saving options.

### Common Products Shoppers Compare Prices For:

- Pet supplies  
- Cars and auto accessories  
- Groceries  
- Tools  
- Travel services  
- School and office supplies  
- Clothes  

Retailers must offer competitive pricing alongside perks like free shipping, curbside pickup, and excellent customer service to capture these price-conscious consumers.
