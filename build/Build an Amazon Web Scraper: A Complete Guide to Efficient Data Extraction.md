## Amazon Web Scraping Techniques

### Using Python
Python is a popular choice for web scraping due to its libraries like Beautiful Soup and Scrapy. A simple script can collect Amazon product details such as titles, prices, and availability.

Example Code:
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'  # Replace with your ScraperAPI key
url = "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=laptops"

payload = {"api_key": API_KEY, "url": url}
response = requests.get("http://api.scraperapi.com", params=payload)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")

products = soup.find_all("div", class_="s-product-item")
for product in products:
    title = product.find("span", class_="s-title").text
    price = product.find("span", class_="s-price").text
    print(f"Product: {title} | Price: {price}")
```

### Using Amazonâ€™s API
While Amazon provides APIs for developers, these APIs often come with rate limits and restricted data access. Web scraping offers greater flexibility and granularity.
