## What is Web Scraping?

Web scraping is an automated process of extracting large amounts of data from websites. Instead of manually copying information, scrapers download the HTML code of a webpage and parse it into structured data formats like CSV, JSON, or databases. This is commonly done using libraries like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, or Selenium in Python, though there are also no-code scraping tools available.

## Choosing Your Web Scraping Tools

The choice of web scraping tools depends on your goals and technical expertise. Some common options include:

- **Libraries**: Requests, BeautifulSoup, Cheerio
- **Frameworks**: Scrapy, Selenium
- **APIs**: [ScraperAPI](https://bit.ly/Scraperapi), Zyte API, Smartproxyâ€™s Web Scraping API
- **Ready-Made Tools**: ParseHub, Octoparse

Python is the most popular programming language for web scraping due to its vast ecosystem of libraries. For non-coders, ready-made scraping tools can simplify the process without the need for programming skills.

### Why Use Proxies?

Web scraping often triggers anti-scraping mechanisms like IP blocks or CAPTCHAs. Proxies act as intermediaries, masking your IP address and allowing access to geo-restricted content. They are essential for high-volume data collection, ensuring your scraper doesnâ€™t get blocked.
