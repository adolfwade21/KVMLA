# How to Retrieve Amazon Payments Tax Collection Models

## Understanding Amazon Payments Reports

Amazon Payments reports provide sellers with detailed transaction summaries for specified settlement cycles. These reports include all financial activity, such as sales orders, fees, and adjustments like coupons or refunds. To obtain these reports, itâ€™s essential to understand key concepts and the process of retrieving the data efficiently.

## Key Concepts of Payments and Web Scraping

### Payments Overview

Amazon Payments reports are automatically generated by Amazon to summarize sellers' settlement data. These reports break down every transaction, not limited to sales orders but also including other fees like coupons, deals, or removals. Sellers rely on these reports to monitor their financial activities and make data-driven decisions.

### Web Scraping for Data Retrieval

Since Amazon Payments does not provide external APIs for accessing these reports, web scraping becomes an essential tool. Web scraping involves using a program or script to simulate user actions, such as logging in, navigating through menus, selecting criteria, and downloading files. Python is one of the most popular programming languages for building web scrapers.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Retrieving Payments Data

### 1. Designing the Solution

To retrieve Amazon Payments data, web scraping is the only viable option. The scraper should simulate the following actions:

- Navigate to the **Reports** > **Payments** > **Standard Orders/Invoiced Orders** > **Date Range Reports** menu.
- Generate and download the report.
- Transfer the downloaded file to a server for parsing and storing the data in a database.

### 2. Setting Up the Development Environment

The development environment should be designed to handle Amazon's strict account association and anti-fraud mechanisms. Consider using virtual machines (like Baolian Cloud) to isolate accounts and maintain strong anti-correlation measures. Each account should have a separate development environment for secure data scraping.

### 3. Scheduling Tasks

Automate the scraping process using scheduled tasks to meet operational needs. For example, if your company reviews profitability weekly, schedule the scraper to run weekly and pull the necessary data.

**Recommended Schedule Example:**
- **Frequency:** Every Sunday starting at 12:00 AM, with a 3-hour interval.
- **Data Range:** From the previous Saturday to the current Saturday.
- **Tip:** Include data up to Saturday instead of Friday, as time zone differences (e.g., in Europe) may result in missed data for late-night transactions.

### 4. Extracting and Mapping Fields

The downloaded reports may differ in format and language depending on the marketplace (e.g., French for France, German for Germany). It's crucial to:

- Map headers from local languages to your internal system's terminology.
- Customize translations instead of relying on automated tools like Google Translate.

Additionally, you may encounter discrepancies in field availability across different marketplaces. For example, Japanese reports might include fees for Amazon points, which are not present in other regions.

### 5. Associating Related Data

Enhance your analysis by linking the retrieved fields with additional data points:

- **Product Details:** Match SKUs to internal product information like brand, series, or company codes.
- **Order Sources:** Distinguish between Amazon orders and third-party orders (e.g., Shopify orders fulfilled via FBA).
- **Missing SKUs:** Fill in missing SKUs for records like coupons or deals by cross-referencing sub-reports.
- **Account Ownership:** Associate accounts with their respective companies for easier tracking.

## User Interface and Reporting Features

Once the data is retrieved, it should be accessible through a user-friendly web interface. Create two types of menus for better usability:

1. **Raw Data Menu:** Displays unprocessed scraped data for record-keeping and troubleshooting.
2. **Processed Data Menu:** Displays data enhanced with additional fields, translations, and adjustments.

Include standard web form functionalities such as search, reset, and export options.
