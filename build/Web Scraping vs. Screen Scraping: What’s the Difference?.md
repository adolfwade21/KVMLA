# Web Scraping vs. Screen Scraping: Whatâ€™s the Difference?

Web scraping and screen scraping are two terms often used interchangeably, but they refer to different data extraction techniques. In this article, weâ€™ll dive into what each one entails, when to use them, and the key differences between web scraping and screen scraping.

## What is Screen Scraping?

Screen scraping involves extracting data directly from a user interface (UI) rather than accessing it programmatically via an API or database query. The "screen" being scraped is typically a desktop application or web page displayed on a userâ€™s monitor.

### Examples of Screen Scraping

- Copying data from a legacy desktop application without an API into a spreadsheet.
- Using automated bots to simulate mouse clicks and keyboard inputs to extract data from a software interface.
- Taking a screenshot of a chart and using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract the data.

Screen scraping tools analyze pixel data and mimic user interactions to extract data. The primary focus is on retrieving data displayed on-screen, not from the underlying data source.

### When to Use Screen Scraping

Screen scraping is ideal in these scenarios:

- **Data Migration**: Transferring data from legacy systems to newer applications by scraping screens and reformatting the data.
- **Application Integration**: Enabling two applications without APIs to share data by scraping one interface and inputting it into another.
- **Testing**: Scraping on-screen data to verify that the correct information is displayed by an application.
- **Data Collection**: Gathering data from software without accessible databases or APIs, such as pricing or inventory data.

### Drawbacks of Screen Scraping

While screen scraping can be useful, it comes with drawbacks:

- **Fragility**: Susceptible to breaking when the UI changes, requiring constant maintenance.
- **Limited Data Access**: Restricted to the data visible on-screen.
- **Legal Issues**: Risk of copyright concerns around replicating UI displays.
- **Higher Complexity**: Requires simulating user interactions rather than directly accessing data.

Screen scraping is a last resort for extracting data when no better options, such as APIs or database access, are available.

## What is Web Scraping?

Web scraping refers to the automated extraction of data from websites. It parses HTML code to extract relevant information into a structured format like a spreadsheet or database.

### Examples of Web Scraping

- Extracting product listings from e-commerce sites for price monitoring.
- Compiling contact details from multiple sites into a lead list.
- Aggregating news articles from various sources into a single feed.

Unlike screen scraping, web scraping focuses directly on the underlying HTML code, bypassing the user interface.

### When to Use Web Scraping

Common use cases for web scraping include:

- **Price Monitoring**: Tracking product prices on competitor websites for dynamic pricing strategies.
- **Lead Generation**: Building prospect lists by scraping directories and gathering contact information.
- **Market Research**: Analyzing trends, reviews, and discussions from forums and websites.
- **News Monitoring**: Aggregating press releases and news articles from multiple sources.
- **Data Aggregation**: Combining related data from various websites into a single structured dataset.

Web scraping is ideal for harvesting unstructured public data from websites at scale.

### Benefits of Web Scraping

Key advantages of web scraping include:

- **Wide Data Access**: Enables extraction of large volumes of public website data.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Cheaper and faster than manual data collection.
- **Automation**: Operates 24/7 and adapts to site changes using self-healing scrapers.
- **Scalability**: Can scrape data from thousands of sites and millions of pages.
- **Structured Data**: Outputs clean, structured data ready for analysis.

When done correctly, web scraping provides an efficient way to access publicly available data.

## Key Differences Between Web Scraping and Screen Scraping

The primary difference is that web scraping targets raw HTML code, while screen scraping focuses on the user interface presentation.

**Summary of Use Cases:**

- **Web Scraping**: Use it for extracting data directly from websites. This is the most efficient and scalable option in most cases.
- **Screen Scraping**: Use it only when thereâ€™s no direct data access, and the data must be extracted via the UI.

Screen scraping also has a range of tools:

1. **OCR Software**: Tools like ABBYY FineReader extract text and data from images and PDFs.
2. **Data Capture Automation**: Platforms like Kapow record and replay user interactions to automate data extraction.
3. **Image Recognition APIs**: Services like Microsoft Computer Vision and Google Cloud Vision analyze screenshots to extract data.
4. **Screen Recording**: Recording sessions and extracting data with OCR or vision APIs.
5. **Custom Coding**: Languages like Python allow developers to build screen scrapers using image processing and automation libraries.

## Wrapping Up

- Web scraping extracts raw HTML data from websites, while screen scraping retrieves data from user interfaces.
- Web scraping is generally better for aggregating web data, whereas screen scraping is a last resort for extracting application data.
- Both methods have a wide variety of tools available, from browser extensions to custom programming libraries.

In most cases, direct database queries or APIs are preferable to scraping techniques. However, when these options arenâ€™t available, web and screen scraping provide valuable alternatives for unlocking inaccessible data.
