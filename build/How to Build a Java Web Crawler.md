# How to Build a Java Web Crawler

Creating a web crawler is a smart way of retrieving useful information available online. With a web crawler, you can scan the Internet, browse through individual websites, and analyze and extract their content.

The Java programming language provides an efficient way of building a web crawler and harvesting data from websites. You can use the extracted data for various purposes, such as analytics, providing third-party services, or generating statistical insights.

In this article, weâ€™ll guide you through building a web crawler using Java and ScraperAPI.

## What Youâ€™ll Need

Web crawling involves writing a script to send requests to targeted web pages, access their HTML code, and scrape the required information. To achieve this, youâ€™ll need the following:

- Java 11 development environment
- [ScraperAPI](https://bit.ly/Scraperapi)

### Why Choose ScraperAPI for Crawling?

ScraperAPI is a powerful tool for data crawling and scraping. Hereâ€™s why itâ€™s the best choice for your web crawling projects:

- **Ease of Use**: ScraperAPI offers a straightforward API that you can set up with just a few lines of code.
- **Advanced Crawling**: With support for JavaScript rendering and a headless browser, ScraperAPI enables you to scrape data from dynamic websites built with modern frameworks like Angular or React.
- **Obstacle Bypassing**: ScraperAPI helps bypass restrictions such as CAPTCHAs, access blocks, and IP bans. It also ensures anonymous crawling using an extensive proxy network.
- **Free Trial**: Start with a free trial that includes 1,000 credits, letting you explore ScraperAPI's capabilities without payment details.

Stop wasting time on proxies and CAPTCHAs! ScraperAPI's simple API handles millions of web scraping requests, so you can focus on the data. Get structured data from Amazon, Google, Walmart, and more. ðŸ‘‰ [Start your free trial today!](https://bit.ly/Scraperapi)

## How ScraperAPI Works

ScraperAPI provides a reliable API for crawling and scraping data. You can integrate this API into your Java project to retrieve web page information effortlessly.

### API Request Basics

Each ScraperAPI request begins with this base URL:

```
https://api.scraperapi.com
```

#### Required Parameters
1. **Authentication Token**: Your unique token, provided upon signing up, authorizes your use of the API.  
   Example:
   ```
   https://api.scraperapi.com?token=SCRAPE9837861
   ```

2. **URL**: Specify the URL you want to crawl, fully encoded.  
   Example:
   ```
   https://api.scraperapi.com?token=SCRAPE9837861&url=INSERT_ENCODED_URL
   ```

Advanced parameters, such as `render=true` for dynamic content or `page_wait` for JavaScript-rendered pages, can also be added.

## Building a Java Web Crawler with ScraperAPI

In this tutorial, weâ€™ll use the `HttpClient` API introduced in Java 11. It supports HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2, with features for synchronous and asynchronous request handling.

### Step 1: HttpRequest
To create an HTTP request, use `HttpRequest.newBuilder()`. This builder supports methods like `uri()` (for URL), `GET()` (for HTTP method), and `timeout()` (to set request timeout).

#### Example: Encoding URL for ScraperAPI
```java
String url = URLEncoder.encode("https://example.com", StandardCharsets.UTF_8.name());
HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
    .GET()
    .uri(URI.create("https://api.scraperapi.com/?token=SCRAPE9837861&url=" + url))
    .build();
```

---

### Step 2: HttpClient
The `HttpClient` class acts as the main component for sending requests and receiving responses. It can be instantiated using `HttpClient.newBuilder()` or `HttpClient.newHttpClient()`.

#### Example: Sending a Request
Synchronous Example:
```java
HttpClient client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();
HttpResponse<String> response = client.send(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
System.out.println(response.body());
```

Asynchronous Example:
```java
CompletableFuture<HttpResponse<String>> response = client.sendAsync(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
response.thenAccept(res -> System.out.println(res.body()));
```

---

### Step 3: HttpResponse
The `HttpResponse` object contains methods to handle the response:
- `statusCode()`: Returns the HTTP status code.
- `body()`: Returns the response body.

#### Example: Saving Response to a File
```java
HttpResponse<Path> response = client.send(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofFile(Paths.get("output.html")));
```

## Full Example: Synchronous Web Crawler in Java
Below is a complete example of a simple web crawler using ScraperAPI and Java's `HttpClient`:

```java
package javaHttpClient;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.URI;
import java.net.URLEncoder;
import java.net.http.HttpClient;
import java.net.http.HttpRequest;
import java.net.http.HttpResponse;
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;

public class WebCrawler {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, InterruptedException {
        // Encode URL
        String url = URLEncoder.encode("https://example.com", StandardCharsets.UTF_8.name());

        // Create HttpClient
        HttpClient client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();

        // Create HttpRequest
        HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
            .GET()
            .uri(URI.create("https://api.scraperapi.com/?token=SCRAPE9837861&url=" + url))
            .build();

        // Send request and handle response
        HttpResponse<String> response = client.send(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
        System.out.println(response.body());
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Building a web crawler in Java is straightforward with the `HttpClient` API introduced in Java 11. When combined with ScraperAPI, web crawling becomes even more efficient and effective.

ScraperAPI helps you bypass common scraping obstacles, access dynamic content, and retrieve data anonymously. Itâ€™s the perfect tool for taking your web crawling to the next level.
