# Create an eBay Scraper in Python Using ScraperAPI

In this guide, weâ€™ll build an eBay scraper using Python and ScraperAPI to fetch and parse eBay listings data. eBay, a popular online auction platform, is rich with listings that can be scraped to monitor prices, analyze trends, or gather data for further processing.

We will write two scripts:
1. **Fetch Listings**: To gather eBay listing URLs and save them into a file.
2. **Parse Listings**: To extract detailed information like title, price, seller, and images.

By using [ScraperAPI](https://bit.ly/Scraperapi), we can bypass common scraping challenges like IP bans and dynamic rendering, ensuring smooth and reliable data extraction.

## Step 1: Fetch eBay Listing URLs

The first script fetches eBay listing URLs from a specific category and saves them to a text file.

### Python Script for Fetching URLs

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

if __name__ == '__main__':
    API_KEY = None
    links_file = 'links.txt'
    links = []

    # Load API key from file
    with open('API_KEY.txt', encoding='utf8') as f:
        API_KEY = f.read().strip()

    # URL to scrape
    URL_TO_SCRAPE = 'https://www.ebay.com/b/Computer-Components-Parts/175673/bn_1643095'

    # ScraperAPI parameters
    payload = {'api_key': API_KEY, 'url': URL_TO_SCRAPE, 'render': 'false'}

    # Fetch page content
    r = requests.get('http://api.scraperapi.com', params=payload, timeout=60)
    if r.status_code == 200:
        html = r.text.strip()
        soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'lxml')

        # Extract listing links
        entries = soup.select('.s-item a')
        for entry in entries:
            if 'p/' in entry['href']:
                listing_url = entry['href'].replace('&amp;rt=nc#UserReviews', '')
                links.append(listing_url)

    # Save links to file
    if links:
        with open(links_file, 'a+', encoding='utf8') as f:
            f.write('\n'.join(links))
        print('Links stored successfully.')
```

This script uses ScraperAPI to fetch eBay listings and stores the URLs in a file named `links.txt`.

## Step 2: Parse eBay Listings

The second script parses individual listing pages and extracts details such as the title, price, seller, and image.

### Python Script for Parsing Listings

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

if __name__ == '__main__':
    record = {}
    price = title = seller = image = None

    # Load API key from file
    with open('API_KEY.txt', encoding='utf8') as f:
        API_KEY = f.read().strip()

    # URL to scrape
    URL_TO_SCRAPE = 'https://www.ebay.com/p/5034585650?iid=202781903791'

    # ScraperAPI parameters
    payload = {'api_key': API_KEY, 'url': URL_TO_SCRAPE, 'render': 'false'}

    # Fetch page content
    r = requests.get('http://api.scraperapi.com', params=payload, timeout=60)
    if r.status_code == 200:
        html = r.text
        soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'lxml')

        # Extract title
        title_section = soup.select('.product-title')
        if title_section:
            title = title_section[0].text.strip()

        # Extract seller
        seller_section = soup.select('.seller-persona')
        if seller_section:
            seller = seller_section[0].text.replace('Sold by', '').replace('Positive feedbackContact seller', '').strip()

        # Extract price
        price_section = soup.select('.display-price')
        if price_section:
            price = price_section[0].text.strip()

        # Extract image
        image_section = soup.select('.vi-image-gallery__enlarge-link img')
        if image_section:
            image = image_section[0]['src']

        # Store data in a record
        record = {
            'title': title,
            'price': price,
            'seller': seller,
            'image': image,
        }

        print(record)
```

### Example Output

When you run the script, youâ€™ll get an output like this:

```json
{
  "title": "AMD Ryzen 3 3200G - 3.6GHz Quad Core (YD3200C5FHBOX) Processor",
  "price": "$99.99",
  "seller": "best_buy (698388)97.2%",
  "image": "https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/ss8AAOSwsbhdmy2e/s-l640.jpg"
}
```

## Enhancing Your Scraper

This script can be further customized for advanced use cases, such as:

- **Price Monitoring**: Track price changes for specific products.
- **Data Storage**: Save extracted data to a database or CSV file for further analysis.
- **Dynamic Categories**: Scrape multiple eBay categories dynamically by updating the input URLs.
