### Step 2: Set Up API Parameters

```

### Step 3: Save the Results to a CSV File

with open('google_shopping.csv', 'w', encoding='UTF8', newline='') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)

    # Write the header
    writer.writerow(header)

    # Write the rows
    for item in results:
        writer.writerow([
            item.get('position'), 
            item.get('title'), 
            item.get('link'),
