# Everything You Need to Know About Web Scraping with Web Scrapers

## What Is Web Scraping?

Web scraping is a computerized process used to collect large amounts of data from websites. It is also commonly referred to as web data extraction or web data scraping.

**Web scraping consists of two essential components – a crawler and a scraper.**

- A crawler is an AI algorithm that searches for specific data by following links across the internet.
- A scraper is a specialized tool designed to extract data from websites. The design of a scraper may vary significantly depending on the complexity and scale of the project to ensure fast and accurate data extraction.

In essence, if you’ve ever copied and pasted data from a website, you’ve performed the same task as a web scraper. The difference is that you did it manually.

Although web scraping can be done manually, automated tools are often preferred as they are faster and more cost-effective.

Web scraping uses machine learning and intelligent automation to retrieve hundreds, millions, or even billions of data points from the vast expanse of the internet.

However, it’s important to note that encountering website blocks and CAPTCHAs is inevitable when performing web scraping.

## Crawler vs. Scraper: What’s the Difference?

Let’s use a simpler analogy: **a cow and a plow**.

The crawler plays the role of the cow in the digital world, guiding the scraper (the plow) to complete the task.

In other words, the crawler guides the scraper across the internet to extract the desired data, similar to manual operations.

### Web Crawlers

Web crawlers, often referred to as “spiders,” are fundamental programs that browse the web to search and index content.

They navigate the internet by following links and exploring websites to search and index content. In many programs, the entire internet or a specific site is first "crawled" to discover URLs, which are then passed to the scraper.

### Web Scrapers

Web scrapers are specialized tools designed to accurately and quickly extract data and related information from web pages. The design and complexity of web scrapers vary greatly depending on the specific project.

## How Do Web Scrapers Work?

How does a web scraper work? The process may appear simple but is actually a bit complex. After all, websites are built for humans, not machines.

Here’s how a web scraper typically operates:

1. Before scraping, the scraper obtains one or more URLs to load and then loads all the HTML code of those sites. Advanced scrapers might render the entire site, extracting CSS and JavaScript elements as well.
2. The scraper extracts the required data from the HTML code or from specific data pre-selected by the user and outputs it in the desired format.
3. Users typically need to select the specific data they want from the page. For instance, you may only want to scrape the price and model from an Amazon product page, rather than product reviews.
4. Finally, the scraper outputs all the collected data into a format useful to the user, often in CSV or Excel spreadsheets. Advanced scrapers may also support API-ready JSON formats.

## Types of Web Scrapers

There are several types of web scrapers available:

- **Custom-built**  
- **Pre-built**  
- **Browser extensions**  
- **Desktop software**  
- **User interface-based tools**  
- **Cloud-based web scrapers**

### 1. Custom-Built Web Scrapers

Just like building a website, anyone can create their own web scraper. However, this requires advanced programming knowledge. Building an effective crawler may require even deeper expertise.

### 2. Pre-Built Web Scrapers

Unlike custom-built tools, pre-built web scrapers often come with customizable advanced options. You simply download and run them. Features like scraping schedules, JSON, and Google Sheets exports are part of pre-built web scrapers.

### 3. Browser Extension Scrapers

Browser extensions are programs you can add to browsers like Google Chrome or Firefox. These scrapers are convenient as they integrate with the browser, making them easy to operate.

However, browser extension scrapers are limited to the browser's capabilities. For instance, **IP rotation is not possible when using these tools.**

### 4. Desktop Software Scrapers

Desktop software scrapers are more complex than browser-based tools, as they are installed and set up on your computer. They are not limited by browser constraints, making them more powerful for advanced tasks.

### 5. User Interface Scrapers

These tools offer a user-friendly interface where users can input URLs, set parameters, and view results without writing code. They are ideal for users with limited technical knowledge.

### 6. Cloud-Based Scrapers

Unlike local web scrapers that run on your computer and use its resources, cloud-based scrapers operate remotely. This avoids slowing down your computer during scraping activities and allows your device to focus on other tasks.

## Uses of Web Scraping

### 1. Market Research

Web scraping provides valuable data for companies to analyze consumers and plan their future strategies. Use cases include:

- Collecting product, pricing, and customer review data from e-commerce sites.
- Monitoring competitor websites for pricing, product launches, and promotions.
- Extracting stock prices, financial reports, and market news for investment analysis.

### 2. Content Aggregation

Stay informed by aggregating data from multiple sources:

- Collecting news articles from various platforms.
- Aggregating job postings into a searchable database.
- Compiling property listings from different real estate websites.

### 3. Academic Research

Web scraping is useful for gathering large datasets for academic purposes, such as:

- Mining data for research, such as scientific publications or statistical data.
- Performing sentiment analysis using scraped social media posts, product reviews, or news articles.

### 4. Monitoring and Alerts

Examples include:

- Tracking product prices and setting alerts for price drops.
- Monitoring website changes like updated terms of service or new product launches.

### 5. Business Automation

Examples include:

- Automating form submissions.
- Automatically updating website content using scraped data from other sources.

### 6. E-commerce

Examples include:

- Capturing product details and images for building catalogs.
- Monitoring stock levels and availability across suppliers.

## Is Web Scraping Legal?

Web scraping itself is not illegal, but it may violate other laws or regulations in specific cases, such as:

- Scraping protected data or content subject to copyright.
- Violating terms of service that explicitly prohibit data scraping.
- Accessing non-public data.

Always follow best practices to ensure compliance.

## Best Practices for Web Scraping

1. **Use APIs Instead of Scraping**: Many websites offer APIs for data retrieval.
2. **Respect Terms of Service**: Check the website’s terms before scraping.
3. **Follow Robots.txt**: This file indicates which pages can or cannot be scraped.
4. **Verify Copyright**: Confirm data usage complies with copyright laws.
